# Power Consumption & Efficiency Analysis of Electronic Devices

This project analyzes the **power consumption** and **energy usage efficiency** of common household electronic devices using basic electrical principles and data analysis techniques in Python.

---

##  Overview

- **Physics Used:**  
  - Power (W) = Voltage Ã— Current  
  - Energy (Wh) = Power Ã— Time  
-  **Tools & Libraries:**  
  - Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
  - Jupyter Notebook  
  - Excel for raw data storage

## Dataset

The dataset contains voltage, current, and time usage values for 5 household electronic devices:

| Device         | Voltage (V) | Current (A) | Time Used (hr) |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Phone Charger  | 230         | 0.15        | 2              |
| LED Bulb       | 230         | 0.05        | 5              |
| Laptop Adapter | 230         | 0.5         | 3              |
| Ceiling Fan    | 230         | 0.2         | 4              |
| Iron           | 230         | 5           | 0.5            |

##  Analysis Performed

- ðŸ”§ Calculated:
  - Power in Watts (W)
  - Energy in Watt-hours (Wh)
- Visualized:
  - Bar chart: Power consumption by device
  - Bar chart: Energy usage by device
  - Pie chart: Energy share per device

---

##  Key Insights

- Devices like **irons** consume very high power even if used briefly.
- Low-power devices like **LED bulbs** can run for hours with minimal energy cost.
- This analysis helps users optimize their energy consumption at home.
